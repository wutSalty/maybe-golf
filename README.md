# maybe-golf
A 2D, top-down, golf game with a lot of secrets and unexpected turns. This repo contains the source code and all of the commits for the Unity project. To access the installer version of this game, feel free to go [download-golf](https://github.com/wutSalty/download-golf). download-golf may be slightly behind this repo, but the in-game installer will always grab the latest release from there.

Estimated day of completion will be Week 35 of the Year 22. I must or else I fail.
